Hello! I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student at Arizona State University's School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence (SCAI). I work with [Hannah Kerner](https://hannah-rae.github.io/) on algorithmic biases in vision and language tasks. I am curious to learn what factors cause biases in AI models.

Prior to joining ASU, I worked as a Junior Research Fellow at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) with [Ravi Kiran S](https://ravika.github.io/index.html). I worked on a variety of vision applications, including pose estimation, object tracking, and segmentation. I completed my undergraduate study in Computer Science from [Amrita University](https://www.amrita.edu/) in 2020.  

To know more about my work and past experiences, feel free to check out my [CV](http://rahul1801.github.io/files/Resume_Rahul_Nair.pdf).
